- Hi, Iâ€™m @punksci
- I'm a science teacher turned computer science teacher
- Started learning HTML/CSS/JavaScript in 2016
- Currently, only my portfolio website is in a repository 
- I plan to 'wrap-up' some of my projects and set them in repositories this summer
- For now, I just have a sad repository list.

- hope to find the time to spend with GitHub this summer ('22)
