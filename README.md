- Hi, Iâ€™m @punksci
- I'm a science teacher turned computer science teacher
- I first started learning HTML/CSS/JavaScript in 2016
- I have nothing to throw on my repository at this moment
- I plan to come back to this and build at least a respectable repository <br> you know - to show my skills and such.

- hope to find the time to spend with GitHub this summer ('22)
